    Ways To Learn English

    This method is suitable for those who perceive learning better through the visual channel. Also, movies will enrich
    your vocabulary with colloquial phrases, which are most often used by native speakers. If your level exceeds at
    least A1 or A2, you can start watching movies with Russian subtitles.
  </p>

  <p>
    In films, you can learn new idioms, phrasal verbs, slang. This is a vocabulary that cannot be learned from
    textbooks,
    since the language develops much faster than the educational literature has time to be printed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Watching movies in the original, you can hear the voice of your favorite character or watch them almost the very
    first, since the official translation and voice acting takes a lot of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not sure of your pronunciation, movies will be able to help you, because when watching you will listen to
    the speech of native speakers.
    You will get acquainted with the culture of other countries, because most films mention holidays, traditions and
    customs.
  </p>
  <p>
    But for each level there are movies that you can watch without any difficulties.
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    I have prepared a list of two films for each level:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A1 – “Up”, “Minions”</li>
    <li>A2 – “The Holiday”, “The Lion King”</li>
    <li>B1 – “Shrek”, “Toy Story”</li>
    <li>B2 – “The Hangover”, “(500) Days of Summer”</li>
    <li>C1 – “Breakfast at Tiffany's”, “The Social Network”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have a C2 level, you can watch everything from this list, since with this level you can already teach and
    translate anything yourself.
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    A couple of tips:
  </p>
  <p>
    In the beginning, it is better not to watch films on some specific topic, because there are a lot of terms in them,
    and you may literally not have time to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Watching movies with friends is much more fun and if you don't understand something, it's likely that your friends
    will tell you or explain. And then it will be possible to discuss the watched movie together (even in English)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you come across an unfamiliar word, you can look up its meaning in a monolingual dictionary, in which a complex
    word is explained by easier ones.
    Even if you are watching a movie with subtitles, it is better to try to perceive it by ear, so you improve your
    listening skills and stop "reading" the movie.
