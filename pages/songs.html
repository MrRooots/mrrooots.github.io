  <p>
    We all love music, regardless of age or language level, because all of us have ever had songs stuck in our
    minds,
    and
    we hummed them anywhere and at any time of the day. It means that in this way you can improve your English.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have at least a couple of favorite songs in English, or just those that you don't hesitate to hum - just
    look
    at the lyrics, there's nothing complicated about it, and progress will already begin, because many people don't
    even
    know the words of the songs they like. After reading the lyrics, you will understand what is being sung about.
  </p>
  <div style="clear: left;"></div>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    In order to listen to music and watch the lyrics, there are special applications, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spotify</li>
    <li>MusixMatch</li>
    <li>Genius</li>
    <li>QuickLyric</li>
    <li>Shazam</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From the songs you can get a ton of beautiful expressions, useful phrases. Their language is extremely simple and
    suitable for use in speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also choose those performers for whom English is their native language, in other words, who are native speakers,
    because pronunciation errors are one hundred percent excluded.
  </p>
  <p>
    The songs have their own special advantage – ease of use. You can turn on the music with headphones and go outside,
    which, obviously, you will not be able to do with a textbook in your hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music clearly awakens at least some emotions, and what is more pleasant is easier to remember.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those whose level is beginner, it is best to start with Disney songs or something really simple, where there
    will be no quick text or complicated words.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, performers sometimes sing unintelligibly on purpose, it is also better not to start with such songs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start with pop music, because songs of this genre very often use the same words like “love” “lovely” “breath”, and
    repetition is one of the best ways to remember words. And by learning other words that are more complex or related
    to
    some profession, you replenish your passive vocabulary, that is, you are unlikely to use these words in ordinary
    speech, but if you see them in some text on an exam or just in a lesson at school, you will instantly recognize
    them.
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    In my opinion, good songs for learning English are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adele – Skyfall</li>
    <li>Britney Spears – oops!... I did it again</li>
    <li>Whitney Houston – I will always love you</li>
    <li>Glass Animals – Heat Waves</li>
    <li>The Neighbourhood – Sweater Weather</li>
    <li>Sia – Unstoppable</li>
    <li>Lana Del Rey – Young and Beautiful</li>
  </ul>
