  <p>
    Learning English from TV shows is almost identical to movies, but TV shows obviously last longer, that is, you can
    immerse yourself in the plot and forget that you are watching in a foreign language.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the moment, TV shows are not only entertainment, but also a reflection of social problems, traditions, thoughts
    of
    society, so, as I said before, you will learn the culture of another country.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended to watch those series that you have already viewed in Russian. Thus, you will understand exactly
    what is being discussed, but not in your native language.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will begin to learn real everyday English, without pauses between each phrase, as in textbooks. You will also
    encounter different accents, most likely either American or British, and I am sure that you will be able to feel the
    difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the jokes in English TV series consist of word games, so watching with dubbing, you may not understand them.
    Again, if you discuss what you have viewed in English with a person whose language level is higher than yours, you
    will begin to solve one of the most common problems – the language barrier, which prevents many students from
    developing speaking skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people watch TV shows with subtitles, but there are tips for using them. In the beginning, it is better to use
    double subtitles, which are available on different sites. You will immediately see both Russian and English
    subtitles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, you can switch only to English, and in the end without them at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    You cannot be lazy even with such a study. If you do not understand a certain moment or a dialogue - revise it,
    catch
    the subtlety in pronunciation, remember a new word or a whole stable expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like movies, TV shows need to be watched by levels. From beginner to near the level of a native speaker. This time
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">I also prepared a list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A1 - "Extra English", "Private Detective Jack Stark"</li>
    <li>A2 – "The Hollow", "The Umbrella Academy"</li>
    <li>B1 – "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "Friends"</li>
    <li>B2 – "The Vampire Diaries", "The Kardashians"</li>
    <li>C1 – "Peaky Blinders", "Game of Thrones"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Almost the most important thing is not to give up if you don't understand something, because everything can be
    worked
    out by persistent attempts, and if you try on your favorite TV shows, it will be much easier and more enjoyable
