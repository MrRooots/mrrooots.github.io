  <p>
    Learning English by reading books is one of the most effective ways to master this language. No other method allows
    you to expand your vocabulary so well.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first stage is to read English texts adapted for foreigners that are suitable for beginners.
  </p>
  <div style="clear: left;"></div>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    They usually have the following advantages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All the writer's thoughts are expressed in them in a small number of words. Rarely used, complex expressions are
      removed from such texts.
    </li>
    <li>
      The adapted text contains simpler sentences than those used by the author of the original text. They make it
      easier
      to understand their meaning, because the meanings of phrases in English are not created exactly the same as in
      Russian.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In general, you can read any book of English literature that you like, but
    <span class="font-weight-bold">it is reasonable to give preference to
    these works:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oscar Wilde ("The Canterville Ghost");</li>
    <li>Lewis Carroll ("Alice in Wonderland" and "Alice through the Looking Glass");</li>
    <li>Mark Twain ("The Adventures of Tom Sawyer");</li>
    <li>Jerome Salinger ("The Catcher in the Rye")</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Bilingual books</h4>
  <p>
    Bilingual books are a bilingual text written in the original language and the language of translation. There are
    several types: with literal translation and translation in parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The literal translation is suitable for those who have just started learning English. This way of reading helps to
    learn stable expressions, individual words and promotes passive language learning.
    The translation of the text in parts is suitable for those who already know the basic level of the language.
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-bold">
    The advantages of bilingual books can include the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rich vocabulary</li>
    <li>Deep understanding of sentence structures</li>
    <li>Extensive cultural overview</li>
  </ul>
